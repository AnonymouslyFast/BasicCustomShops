# Welcome to BasicCustomShops
Hello! This is a project that I made for practive, this isn't really meant to be useful in anyway, but you're free to use it at your own risk of bugs. 

## Commands

This plugin is mainly configured by commands to do stuff like reloading, and creating subshops and products. To access the shopmanager you would have to have the permission `BCS.shopmanager` or be oped.

```
/shop - Opens the shop GUI where players can buy and sell goods
/shopmanager - Requires permission `BCS.shopmanager` or op to use aswell as it's subcommands
/shopmanager help - Brings up a help message
/shopmanager reload - reloads the config.yml in the plugin dir
/shopmanager reloaddatabase - saves all subshops and products into the database.
/shopmanager createsubshop <String> - creates a subshop with the given name
/shopmanager createproduct <String> - puts you in a product creation tool that will guide you through creating a product for the given subshop.
/subshop deletesubshop <String> - deletes the given subshop
```

## GUI Actions
This plugin uses guis to visualize the shops and have the players buy and sell products. Players with the permission `BCS.shopmanager` or ops can delete subshops and products in the gui aswell.
